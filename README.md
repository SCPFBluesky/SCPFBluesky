## Introduction

Hello! I am DrBloop. Welcome to my Portfilio!

## 🚀 **About me**
* I have been on the Roblox platform for 9+ years.

* Continually learning and gaining deeper knowledge of the Roblox Engine.

* I've started to program in *Luau* around late 2023, I am still a learner myself (so im not the best programmer in the world) but I can get stuff done and right. I have gained a lot of knowledge on how to work with the Roblox Engine. And I have acquired great understanding on how it works and how to use it. I am learning more almost every day, if I don't know something I will dedicate myself to learn it.
